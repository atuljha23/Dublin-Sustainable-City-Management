# Sustainable City Management 
This project focuses on resolving some of the common problems that occur in large cities such as commuting from one point to another via different means of transport and handling traffic, etc. In this project, we mainly focus on 5 basic requirements of the residents of a city (Dublin) they are as follows:

* Dublin Bus Dashboard
